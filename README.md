# Assembly Code on macOS

Links:

* [Writing 64 bit assembly on Mac OS X](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2014/12/02/writing-64-bit-assembly-on-mac-os-x/).This one inspired this repo.
* [OS X Assembly Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/Assembler/000-Introduction/introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000851-CH211-SW1).
* [Assembly language programming under OS X with NASM](http://caswenson.com/2009_09_26_assembly_language_programming_under_os_x_with_nasm). Kind of a standard ASM language here.
* [NASM Hello World example](https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/7125822). Didn't work for me, but worth looking at.
